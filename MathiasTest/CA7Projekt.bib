abstract = {This outstanding introductory treatment of graph theory and its applications has had a long life in the instruction of advanced undergraduates and graduate students in all areas that require knowledge of this subject. The first nine chapters constitute an excellent overall introduction, requiring only some knowledge of set theory and matrix algebra. Topics include paths and circuits, trees and fundamental circuits, planar and dual graphs, vector and matrix representation of graphs, and related subjects. The remaining six chapters are more advanced, covering graph theory algorithms and computer programs, graphs in switching and coding theory, electrical network analysis by graph theory, graph theory in operations research, and more. Instructors may combine these chapters with the preceding material for courses in a variety of fields, including electrical engineering, computer science, operations research, and applied mathematics. Reprint of the Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1974 edition.},

abstract = {Learning how to model a water distribution system is a complicated task. Understanding how to operate a modeling program is a minor part of the overall picture. To effectively use models, the engineer must be able to link knowledge of basic hydraulic theory and the mechanics of the program with that of the operation of real-world systems. The purpose of this book is to provide a practical resource for engineers and modelers that goes well beyond being a how-to guide for typing data into a computer program. It contains straightforward answers to common questions related both to modeling and to distribution systems in general. The scope of this text includes such topics as: - Definitions and industry standards - Model assembly and verification - Effective use of models as decision-support tools - Recent innovations in modeling The method in which these issues are approached is designed to be readily accessible for immediate application by practicing engineers, while sufficiently comprehensive for student use. Continuing Education and Problem Sets Included in this text are approximately 100 hydraulics and modeling problems to give students and professionals the opportunity to apply the material covered in each chapter. The accompanying CD-ROM in the back of the book contains an academic version of Haestad Methods' WaterCAD, which can be used to solve many of the problems, as well as data files with much of the given information in the problems pre-entered.},

@article{Bello2019,
abstract = {Modern water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex and difficult to manage due to increased level of urbanization, varying consumer demands, ageing infrastructure, operational costs, and inadequate water resources. The management problems in such complex networks may be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term, depending on the duration at which the problems are solved or considered. To address the management problems associated with WDNs, mathematical models facilitate analysis and improvement of the performance of water infrastructure at minimum operational cost, and have been used by researchers, water utility managers, and operators. This paper presents a detailed review of the management problems and essential mathematical models that are used to address these problems at various phases of WDNs. In addition, it also discusses the main approaches to address these management problems to meet customer demands at the required pressure in terms of adequate water quantity and quality. Key challenges that are associated with the management of WDNs are discussed. Also, new directions for future research studies are suggested to enable water utility managers and researchers to improve the performance of water distribution networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of the current state of the art of real time control (RTC) of water distribution networks (WDNs). After proving the basic concept and terms of RTC and presenting sensors, regulation devices and controllers typically used in WDNs, the paper goes on by describing the most frequent control objectives, which mainly include service pressure regulation, control of tank filling and energy production in each WDN district. Various control methodologies recently proposed in the scientific literature are presented and discussed, along with experimental and numerical results achieved. Also, aspects related to the cost-effectiveness of RTC are critically analyzed. The paper ends by giving an outlook into potential future developments in the area of RTC for WDNs.},

abstract = {Automatic burst and leak detection in water distribution systems plays an important role in water saving and management. This research develops a novel burst detection method of using adaptive Kalman filtering on hydraulic measurements of flow and pressure at district meter area (DMA) level. Adaptive Kalman filtering is used to model normal water usage (or alternatively water pressure), so the residual of the filter (e.g., the difference between the predicted flow and the measured flow) represents the amount of abnormal water usage relating to the bursts (or newly occurred leaks) in the downstream network. The results from a series of engineered tests which simulated flushing show that the size of the bursts and leaks strongly correlates with the residual of the filter. Finally, the method was applied to data from several real DMAs in the north of England, and the results show that the detected bursts correspond well to known historical operational information such as customer complaints' records and work management (repair) data. The results suggest that flow measurement data are more sensitive to a burst or leak than the pressure measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASCE.},
